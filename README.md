Hey, this is jhos! I'm a developer looking to show my work and to learn from others in this awesome platform. I enjoy programming, playing a various number of games, reading, listening to music and playing music the guitar.

Hi there! My name is Jhosaim and I'm excited to be a part of this platform. As a developer, I'm always looking for ways to showcase my work and collaborate with others to improve my skills. In addition to programming, I enjoy a wide range of hobbies including playing games, reading, listening to music, and playing the guitar.

Allow me to introduce myself! Here are a few things you should know about me:
* I'm currently studying Software Engineering.
* I am fluent in both Spanish and English.
* I have a passion for all things related to software development. I could code all day and never get bored!
* I have hands-on experience working on a Full-Stack project and I'm excited to continue building my skills in this area.
* I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and currently, I'm working on Full-Stack projects while also learning new programming languages.

I hope this provides a clearer picture of who I am and what I'm passionate about.
Looking forward to connecting with others who share the same interests!
